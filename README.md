#### This is a basic, single page web application that's implemented using the React framework.

### Overview
This application allows the user to add and remove items from a burger. It calculates the price of the burger based on the current order.

This application was built largely based off of the React cource from Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/8125748?start=90

In the future, the application will connect to a backend server (Firebase) and allow the user to view past orders.
